/**
 * This is the main ab-hivemind sketch file, which we are using for notes mostly.
 * 
 * It is empty, which might be surprising, or not.
 * 
 * We like to write old-school c++ with header files and everything, so our code lives in ab-hivemind-main.cpp mostly.
 * 
 * By the power of arduino, everything is linked together when the binary is built and flashed.
